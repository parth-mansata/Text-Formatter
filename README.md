# Text-Formatter

Text-Formatter is a powerful tool designed to process HTML content and generate text with enhanced readability and formatting. This tool is particularly beneficial for scenarios where standard formatting options are not available, such as in certain online platforms like Upwork. It ensures that your content remains visually organized and impactful by applying manual formatting techniques.

## Benefits

- **Nested List Formatting:**
  - Automatically adjusts indentation for nested `<ul>` and `<li>` elements.
  - Converts list items into bullet points (`•`) with appropriate levels of indentation for better readability.
  
- **Latin Bold Conversion:**
  - Converts words or phrases enclosed in `<b>` tags or Markdown-style `**bold**` into visually distinct Latin bold characters using Unicode.
  - Ensures that bold text remains prominent even in platforms that do not support rich text formatting.

- **Tab and Spacing Preservation:**
  - Maintains tab spacing and indentation levels, ensuring that structured content such as nested lists or code snippets is preserved.

- **Platform Compatibility:**
  - Ideal for use on platforms with limited text formatting capabilities, enabling users to create well-structured and aesthetically pleasing content.
